# Examples for JavaScript Question Sheet (Q4–Q10)

This folder contains runnable examples that illustrate the answers for Questions 4 through 10 from the `JavaScript_Question_Sheet.pdf`.

Run a single example:

```bash
node examples/q4_example.js
```

Run all examples:

```bash
node examples/run_all.js
```

What each file demonstrates:
- `q4_example.js`: var vs let scoping
- `q5_example.js`: arrow functions and this
- `q6_example.js`: switch-based refactor and invalid input handling
- `q7_example.js`: for vs for...of loops
- `q8_example.js`: refactor loop to filter+map (original code preserved as comment)
- `q9_example.js`: reduce to compute totals with tax and empty-cart handling
- `q10_example.js`: debugging map vs filter
